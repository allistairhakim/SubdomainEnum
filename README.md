# Automatic Subdomain Enumerator and Takeover

**Installation**

```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/allistairhakim/SubdomainEnum.git

# change the working directory
cd SubdomainEnum
```

**Usage**

Essentially uses a wordlist of websites, enumerates subdomains for each, and scans each of the valid ones for takeovers, then updates you if it finds anything then repeats.
Stopped updating this, feel free to use but expect to have to edit some stuff if it doesn't work.
